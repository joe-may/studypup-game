# Description
Have an icy blast in this math-based game! The player must hit the evil snowman that holds the correct answer to the math problem given. Three tries to get it right or you’ll freeze! Good luck!  

# Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery 

# Getting Started
To start the game, click the “START” button. A math problem will be prompted at the bottom left of the screen. Move your cursor crosshairs over the snowman that you believe holds the correct answer, and click to hit him and submit your answer. If you’re correct, the snowman will disappear and a new problem will appear. Keep going until every problem is answered, and every snowman disappeared! If you answer incorrectly three times, you will lose, the game will reset, and you will have to start over.

# Next Steps:

- Add a timer for increased difficulty
- Add motion animations to the answer characters for increased difficulty and style 
- Add music and sound effects 
- Cursor change to a snowball on hover 
- Nova Throwing animation
- Change the background to be an "ice wall"
- Change the answer characters to be "henchmen" of the "Snow king"
